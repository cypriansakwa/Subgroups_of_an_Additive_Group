This Rust program generates and prints all subgroups of the additive group Z_n. 
The additive group Z_n consists of integers n, with addition as the group operation. 
The subgroups of Z_n are cyclic subgroups generated by the divisors of n.
For each divisor dof n, there is a corresponding cyclic subgroup. 
This program computes all such subgroups for a given n and sorts them.
